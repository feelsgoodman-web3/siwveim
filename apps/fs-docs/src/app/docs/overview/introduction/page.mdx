implemented and tested across all "Feels Good Man" apps. This not only ensures its reliability but also offers
developers insights into practical use cases. Dive in, explore its potential, and uplift your development process with
this robust React library.

## Key features

### Accessible

Components are designed in line with WAI-ARIA guidelines wherever feasible. We manage many intricate aspects of
accessibility, encompassing aria and role attributes, focus coordination, and keyboard navigation.

### Prop-driven Styling with Tailwind CSS Integration

Our component library harnesses the power of Tailwind CSS, a highly popular and flexible utility-first CSS framework.
Unlike traditional implementations, we've integrated Tailwind in a unique way: components use props rather than classes
directly. For instance, with the Box component, you can apply margin using a simple prop, eliminating the need to
remember specific class names.

```tsx
<Box m={2}>Box with Margin</Box>
```

This ensures that each component not only looks great out of the box but is also fully customizable. With Tailwind's
atomic classes under the hood, you can effortlessly tweak the appearance and responsiveness of any component to match
your design vision. The prop-driven approach coupled with Tailwind integration simplifies the styling process, boosts
performance, and ensures a consistent look and feel throughout your application. Dive into our library and experience
an intuitive, efficient way to style components.

### Frogspawn Tailwind Plugin: Styling & Theme Integration

Elevate your design game with the Frogspawn Tailwind plugin, a powerful extension designed to work seamlessly with
Tailwind CSS. Our component library not only harnesses the flexibility of Tailwind but also integrates effortlessly
with the Frogspawn plugin, bringing an additional layer of customization and ease.

1. **Effortless Styling:** With the Frogspawn Tailwind plugin, applying styles becomes even more intuitive. The plugin
   enhances the utility-driven approach of Tailwind, allowing developers to craft stunning UIs without getting bogged
   down in the intricacies of CSS.

2. **Prebuilt Themes at Your Fingertips:** One of the standout features of the Frogspawn plugin is its ability to import
   prebuilt themes. Whether you're aiming for a specific aesthetic or looking to adhere to branding guidelines, you can
   easily incorporate a theme that fits your vision. And if you want to get creative, you can mix and match or tweak
   these themes to create a unique look.

By merging the capabilities of Tailwind CSS with the Frogspawn Tailwind plugin, our component library ensures a
streamlined, powerful, and versatile styling experience. Dive in and let your designs come alive with ease and
precision.

### Dark Mode Implementation

Our component library provides built-in support for light and dark themes. This ensures that the components are
versatile and can cater to different user preferences and environments.

Here's how it functions:

1. **Class and Data Attribute Detection:** The CSS structure detects certain identifiers to ascertain the theme. It
   checks for class names (dark or light) and a specific data attribute (data-theme) in the `:root` selector.

2. **Theme Application:** Upon detection, the relevant theme is applied throughout the components. This means components
   can easily switch between light and dark displays based on these identifiers.

By leveraging both class names and data attributes, the library offers flexibility for developers. It simplifies the
process of theme adaptation based on user choice, system settings, or other custom logic. The primary aim is to ensure
our components remain functional and adaptive in various design contexts.

### Optimized Developer Experience

Building with our component library is a joy for developers. We've crafted each component with the developer's ease of
use in mind. Intuitive naming conventions, comprehensive documentation, and a consistent API across all components
ensure a seamless integration process.

Developers can rapidly piece together interfaces without constantly referring
back to the documentation. Plus, with built-in customization options and clear guidelines, adapting the components to
fit any design or functionality requirement becomes a straightforward task. Dive into our library, and experience a
smooth, productive development journey like never before.
